# Battery_State_of_Charge_Estimation_Device

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This is a deep learning approach to estimate State-of-Charge of 18650 Li-Ion batteries in real-time with high accuracy.
The dataset we used can be found here [Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cp3473x7xv/1).
Matlab Code files have been written in Matlab 2020b and all python files have been verified to work in Python 3.9.5.
